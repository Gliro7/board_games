    <h1>Monopoly rules</h1>
    <p>The rules of Monopoly are not difficult, but they are specific. Monopoly can be played by 2+ players, depending on the number of player tokens available.</p>
    <p>Monopoly requires a special board, 32 houses, 12 hotels, Chance and Community Chest cards, Title Deed cards for each property, play money, player tokens, and two six-sided dice.</p>
    <p>Each player chooses a token and places it on ‘Go’, and is provided with $1500 as follows: 2 of each $500’s, $100’s, and $50’s; 6 $20’s; and 5 of each $10’s, $5’s, and $1’s. One player is the Banker. All assets of the Bank should be separate from the Banker’s own assets. The Bank controls all remaining money and all properties and buildings until they are purchased. The Bank can never ‘go broke’ – more money should be made if needed.</p>
    <h2>Game Play</h2>
    <p>According to the rules of Monopoly, the player that roles the highest total on both dice goes first. Game play proceeds clockwise from that player.</p>
    <p>There are 4 main parts to a turn.</p>
    <p>1) Roll the dice. Move the number of squares indicated. If you throw doubles, you take another turn after your turn is completed. Each time you pass ‘Go’, collect $200 from the Bank.</p>
    <p>2) Buy properties. You may buy any property from the Bank that you land on if it is not already owned. If you do not purchase the property, the Banker auctions the property to the highest bidder.</p>
    <p>Some people chose not to use auctions, only allowing properties to be purchased as they are landed on.</p>
    <p>3) Building. You may only build when you own all properties in a color group. Building must be equal on all properties in a group. You may place a single building on a single property, but you may not place two buildings on one property unless all other properties in the group have one building present (even build rule). Any property can have a total of 4 houses, except Utilities and Railroads, which cannot be devloped. To place a hotel on a property, 4 houses must be present on all properties in the group. Houses are removed from the property when a hotel is placed. All buildings are purchased from the Bank.</p>
    <p>4) Complete necessary actions. Pay rent as determined by the Title Deed for the property you are on. Pay Income Tax to the Bank ($200 or 10% of your total assets). Draw a Community Chest or Chance card and follow the instructions. These cards are returned to the bottom of the pile when the action is completed.</p>
